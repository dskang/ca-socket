*** About ***

Tigers Anonymous was built by two Princeton students who wanted to break down the social barriers to making new friends at Princeton. There are tons of amazing people on campus, and Tigers Anonymous was built to help you meet more of them.

*** How It Works ***

1. Be matched

You'll be paired with another Princeton student (anonymously, of course).

2. Start a conversation

We'll provide a fun question to help get the conversation started.

3. Make a new friend

After chatting for a while, you'll get the option to discover your partner's identity. If both of you click "Yes", you can make a new friend! Regardless of whether you decide to stay anonymous or not, it's conversation on your terms.
